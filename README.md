# Automation_using_Python

I've just completed a Python script designed to streamline and automate the reporting process. This powerful tool can:

🔍 Read Data: Seamlessly connect and pull data from multiple sources like SQL databases, Power BI, and Tableau.

⚙️ Run Queries: Execute complex queries across these platforms, making data retrieval more efficient.

📊 Excel Automation: Automatically write the results to Excel, with built-in functionality to format sheets, create pivot tables, and generate insightful charts.

💻 Complete Automation: This script serves as a third-party source-to-Excel report automation tool, ensuring that all reporting needs are met with precision and detail.

I’m thrilled about the potential this script has to save time and reduce manual effort, making data-driven decisions faster and more reliable.
