# Automation_using_Python

I've just completed a Python script designed to streamline and automate the reporting process. This powerful tool can:


🔍 Read Data: Seamlessly connect and pull data from multiple sources like BigQuery, MY SQL, Hive Power BI, and Tableau.


⚙️ Run Queries: Execute complex queries across these platforms, making data retrieval more efficient.


📊 Excel Automation: Automatically write the results to Excel, with custom functionality to format sheets, create pivot tables, and generate insightful charts.


💻 Complete Automation: This script serves as a third-party source-to-Excel report automation tool, ensuring that all reporting needs are met with precision and detail.


This is just a small sample of what the script can do! It’s designed with scalability in mind, meaning it can be extended to run queries on a larger scale. Plus, it has the potential to parallelize workloads, significantly increasing efficiency and reducing the time required for data processing.
